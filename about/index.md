### Welcome!
This is Yigeng Zhang. I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at [RiTUAL Lab], Department of Computer Science, University of Houston. My advisor is [Dr. Thamar Solorio].  
My research interests lie within natural language processing using machine learning methods. I am also broadly interested in recommendation systems, human-centered computing, and computational social science.
